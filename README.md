# AmAai

## Project Description

AmAai, an acronym for 'Ask Me Anything AI', is a robust application that leverages an AI-powered text generation API to inspire ideas for blog posts or transform complex concepts into simpler explanations, thereby fostering understanding while saving time. By entering a few keywords or a succinct prompt, users can generate a comprehensive response within seconds.

The inspiration for this project comes from the emerging use of AI to simplify research across various sectors. AmAai is more than just a tool for idea generation and writer's block relief. But rather, it serves as a guide that provides immediate, instructive, and personalized responses to user queries.

## Future Iterations

Additional features to be added in future iterations may include text sentiment analysis powered by Microsoft Azure's Text Analytics API. This API will assist the user in tailoring the generated content to their desired purpose.

## MVP Features

1. User-friendly interface for inputting prompts and displaying generated blog posts.
2. Integration with Large Language Model API to generate content based on user prompts.
